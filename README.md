Here are the details of the assignment:

- Build a simple aesthetic app to add/delete/list movies that a user has watched.
- Show an infinite scrollable listview containing all the movies that a user has created.
- Implement a form to add a new movie. (Fields to keep: Name, Director and a poster image of the movie)
- Each list item should have a delete icon to remove that movie from the list 
- Store the data in either hive or Shared preference local database.
- Making an app intro where the user is directed on which button to click and how to go about the app 
 
 
Brownie points for integrating persistent google authentication using firebase and then allowing only logged-in users to add movies
